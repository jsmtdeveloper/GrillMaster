# 🤞Assessment Grill Master

Grill master is a project to solve the main task of ISolutions's assessment.

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.2.3.

## 🤷‍♂️Scope
Help our master barbecue chef to optimize order in which barbecue items are grilled. Since the
space on the grill is limited and different grill items have different sizes, you need to calculate
the optimal schedule for grilling. The aim is to optimize the time for barbecuing the entire
menu. The grill measures 20cm x 30cm. The cooking time is the same for all barbecue items.
